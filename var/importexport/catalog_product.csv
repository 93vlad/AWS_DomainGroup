<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Montego uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved&nbsp;with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet&nbsp;per side.&nbsp;Buttress free ovals&nbsp;do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making&nbsp;them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it is good practice to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool&nbsp;is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback&nbsp;on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>",,,,Cartridge Filter,,,0,,/m/e/mediterranean-pool-ltu-cart_1_1.jpg,"15'x54"" Mediterranean Round Above Ground Pool Package",,Liberty 25ga.,,Unibead,,"15' Round Wilbar Mediterranean above ground pool package.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials.

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources</strong> - To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources</strong> - To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool&nbsp;is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback&nbsp;on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool&nbsp;is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback&nbsp;on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool&nbsp;is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback&nbsp;on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with salt systems but can be used with chlorine or other water sanitizers. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it's easy to assemble and has great styling. This pool is a customer favorite and we get a lot of great feedback on this model.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources</strong> - To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>

This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations -&nbsp;</strong>All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>",,,,Cartridge Filter,,,0,,/m/e/mediterranean-pool-bsu-cart_4_8.jpg,"12'x23'x54"" Mediterranean Oval Above Ground Pool Boulder Package",,Boulder Swirl 25ga.,,Unibead,,"12'x23'x54"" Oval Wilbar Mediterranean above ground pool package.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations -&nbsp;</strong>All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>",,,,Sand Filter,,,0,,/m/e/mediterranean-pool-bsu-sand-1_11.jpg,"24'x54"" Mediterranean Round Above Ground Pool Boulder Sand Package",,Boulder Swirl 25ga.,,Unibead,,"24' Round Wilbar Mediterranean above ground pool, boulder liner, sand filter.

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations -&nbsp;</strong>All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Mediterranean</strong> - One of three resin saltwater friendly pools we offer. A great choice for those looking for a high end long lasting feature packed swimming pool. This resin hybrid is a step up from the ""all steel"" pool models. This is due to the fact Mediterranean employs many resin components in its construction. Resin is a high grade plastic material that lasts a long time and weathers very nicely. Because resin does not rust or corrode like metal, making non structural components from resin ensures a long part life. The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations -&nbsp;</strong>All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>",,,,Sand Filter,,,0,,/m/e/mediterranean-pool-bsu-sand-1_4.jpg,"15'x26'x54"" Mediterranean Oval Above Ground Pool Boulder Sand Package",,Boulder Swirl 25ga.,,Unibead,,"15'x26'x54"" Oval Wilbar Mediterranean above ground pool, boulder liner, sand filter.

The solid resin components in this model are the injection molded 7"" top ledges, frame rails, base plates and top plates. The stainless steel service panel wall ensures the skimmer and return jet opening will never corrode. This portion of the pool wall is the most common failing point for all hardwall above ground pools.</p>
<p><strong>Resin Components</strong> - The top ledges are the most likely swimming pool component to see damage like rust, dents, paint fade and warping from use and weather. Top rails are often the first item in need of replacing and making them out of resin ensures they will look good and perform well for decades. This also goes for the resin frame rails and frame base plates. These components rest directly on the ground and are subject to moisture and corrosion. Resin parts here just make good practical sense.</p>
<p><strong>Saltwater Pools</strong> - Mediterranean is a great pool for the person thinking long term. An additional plus is the fact Mediterranean is warrantied for use with a salt system. Today salt water systems for above ground pools are more popular than ever and it takes a hearty pool to stand up to the demands salt pools put on materials. Resin components and stainless steel wall panels are their to ensure Mediterranean stands the test of time. We love this model and feel it is the easy to assemble and has great styling. Mediterranean can be used with chlorine or any other sanitizer. This is a customer favorite. We get many great reviews on this pool.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations -&nbsp;</strong>All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Mediterranean uses the buttress free side support system. Buttress free designs takes up the least amount of yard space enabling this type of oval pool to fit into smaller areas. This is achieved with braces or support beams that only stick out about one and a half feet per side. Buttress free ovals do not have the large angle braces traditional buttress pools use, making them much sleeker and streamline in appearance.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>",,,,Sand Filter,,,0,,/m/e/mediterranean-pool-bsu-sand-1_6.jpg,"18'x33'x54"" Mediterranean Oval Above Ground Pool Boulder Sand Package",,Boulder Swirl 25ga.,,Unibead,,"18'x33'x54"" Oval Wilbar Mediterranean above ground pool, boulder liner, sand filter.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction.

<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe.

Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners.

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe.

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process. With nearly 30 years experience building and selling above ground pools we have the best answers to your questions. Simply call our tech support line for real human assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>

<p><strong>Oval Pool Considerations</strong> - All oval pools use some sort of buttress or side support system to keep the straight sides up and straight. There are two basic buttress designs, traditional buttress and buttress free or yard saver. Caribbean uses the traditional buttress side support system. Traditional buttress designs takes up an additional 3 feet of space on each side on the pool. Example: when building a 15'x30' pool, the space required for it's installation would be 21'x30'. Traditional buttress designs are less expensive than the buttress free models because less steel is required in it's construction. If building a deck around your pool or sinking one partially into the earth, the buttress supports are often not seen. A traditional buttress pool can save up to a thousand dollars on your total pool cost.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Installation Resources -&nbsp;</strong>To help guide you through the pool building process, each pool comes with a paper installation manual as well as an&nbsp;installation DVD. The installation manuals and exploded parts diagrams for each pool model are available for viewing or downloading here on the website. In addition, we share our knowledge, experience and advice with all of our customers by offering unlimited technical assistance and support throughout your pool installation process.

<p><strong>Swimming Pool Installation</strong> <strong>Tips</strong> - When installing a pool in your backyard, it's a good idea to add some sort of liner protection to prevent possible damage from sharp objects, critters and even vegetation. Products like Armor Shield are excellent in preventing sharp rocks, moles or insects from poking holes in your new liner. This incredibly strong Geo-textile material is non-biodegradable and ensures years of swimming pool liner protection. Aside from it's ability to stop damage caused by critters, it's breathable material allows moisture and condensation to escape, preventing premature pool wall corrosion. Armor Shield also extends the factory warranty on your new pool liner. When installing a round&nbsp;pool on concrete of other hard surface, always use Armor Shield pool floor protection and always use the preformed pool base cove. Do not use sand or earth under the liner if installing your pool on hard surfaces like concrete, as rains will wash it away leaving the pool liner to make contact with the pool framework risking possible puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> - Products like plastic sheeting, Styrofoam, roofing paper, vermiculite and perlite are never recommended for use under pool liners. They cause premature pool corrosion as moisture cannot pass through them, leaving the pool walls continuously wet. The use of these and other like materials can easily cut the life expectancy of your new swimming pool in half.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping And Delivery</strong> <strong>Of Above Ground Pools</strong> - Once ordered, above ground pools typically leave our warehouse same or next business day. Because of their size and weight, above ground pools are delivered by freight carrier and not UPS. The freight carrier will deliver your pool to the given delivery address within 5 to 7 business days. Prior to delivery, the freight carrier will call you to scheduled an appointment for the delivery of your new pool. An adult must be at the delivery address at the time of drop off to receive and sign for the shipment.<br /><br /><strong>Building Code Requirements</strong> - It's good practice to check with your local building department for their requirements in regards to above ground pool installations. Permits, proper fencing, property easements, overhead and under ground utilities even septic systems may need to be addressed to ensure a safe legal location for your new pool. In addition, a call to the utility company is of great help, as they will mark out the underground utility lines ensuring cable or telephone lines are not cut during pool installation.</p>
<p><strong>Swimming Pool Safety</strong> - Your above ground pool has been designed to provide you with years of safe, family fun. This entails that water safety must always be taken into account. When used incorrectly, your above ground swimming pool can be dangerous; above ground pools are shallow, and this makes diving and jumping unsafe. To ensure your above ground pool is used safely you must observe the safety precautions that are provided to you when you purchase an above ground pool and conform to all local regulations.</p>
